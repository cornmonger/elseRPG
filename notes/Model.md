The **multiverse** is the official network ran by the elseRPG team that allows third-party __universes__ to interconnect.

A **universe** is a single cohesive third-party game built ontop of the elseRPG engine.

A form of prototyping using **templates** distinguishes between fixed *logical* content and live *dynamic* content.

A logical **zone** is a grouping of in-game content. Multiple zones are logically interconnected to form the total content of the *universe*.

The IT infrastructure of a *universe* is federated across multiple **servers** offering players access to the game. 

Scaling is performed by clustering clones of the same *logical zone* among multiple *servers*, with each effectively offering a *dynamic zone*.

In-game __entities__, including players, may only interact with others within their *dynamic zone*.
